# Chocolate Pizza

## Assignment Overview: Lab 10

### Problem Domain
Your boss has tasked you with creating a single webpage based on provided design comp assets. The goal is to make the page look as close to the preview image as possible within a tight deadline of 2 hours. This assignment focuses more on HTML and CSS, with minimal JavaScript involvement. The project doesn't need to be perfect but should be as polished as possible within the given timeframe.

### Instructions
Your job is to create a page that closely matches the preview image. You will find all required assets in the provided directory within your GitHub class repo. The larger version of the preview image will help guide your design.

### Steps to Complete
1. **Create a New Repository**
   - Name it `chocolate-pizza`.
   - If working with a partner, follow the pair programming workflow by forking each other's repository.
   - Ensure frequent commits and work on branches.

2. **Set Up Your Work Directory**
   - `index.html`: Your main HTML file.
   - `style.css`: Your main CSS file.
   - `app.js` (optional): Your JavaScript file, if you choose to add JS.
   - `img/`: Directory containing all image assets.

3. **Plan Your Approach**
   - **HTML Structure**: Start by building out the structure of the HTML.
   - **Styling**: Focus on styling after the HTML structure is in place.
   - **Layout**: Decide on a layout scheme early in the process.
   - **JavaScript**: Add JS as a finishing touch, if at all.

4. **Development Tips**
   - Use class notes, readings, and external resources as needed.
   - Try different techniques to achieve the desired look.

### Stretch Goals
After completing the core requirements, challenge yourself with the following optional tasks:
- Add JavaScript to your page.
- Make the checkboxes functional using JavaScript.
- Refactor and optimize your code further.
